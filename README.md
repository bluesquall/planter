plant.git
=========

This repository is for a simple script to automate my preferred system 
setup on a fresh install of linux. 

It really just clones and runs another set of tools -- think of it as a
_master script_ of sorts.

Goal
----
Be able to come back to a complete working system after:

1. Installing the base system from a live image, and 

2. running `sudo ./plant.sh`

Future
------
I'm starting this for dealing with Ubuntu (and variants). I'd like to 
have branches for other popular distributions later.
